# Summary of Linked-List

## Some relative probs

1. Reverse linked-list
2. cycle detection / cycle start
    - Floyd cycle detection algorithm (by slow/fast pointer)
3. Find middle node
    - slow(1-step) / fast(2-steps) pointer 
4. Find the k-th node backward from end
    - fast(go k step)
    - slow / fast move forward in same speed
5. Merge two / multiple sorted lists

Note:
- 3 + 5 is the merge sort
- 1 + 4 is the reverse k group
